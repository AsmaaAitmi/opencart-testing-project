# opencart-testing-project
Manual testing project for an OpenCart e-commerce website, covering test cases for homepage, product pages, cart, checkout, and search. Demonstrates test case creation, execution, and documentation.
## Features to Test

In this project, I will test the following features of the OpenCart demo website:

1. **Search**
   - Verify that the search bar returns correct results for valid input.
   - Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., no results found for gibberish).

2. **Add to Cart**
   - Verify that a product can be added to the cart successfully.
   - Check that the cart updates with the correct quantity and price.

3. **Checkout**
   - Test the checkout process, including entering valid and invalid payment details.

4. **Login/Signup**
   - Verify that new users can sign up and existing users can log in with valid credentials.
   - Handle invalid credentials gracefully.

5. **Contact Us Form**
   - Verify that the contact form submits successfully with valid details.
   - Check for error handling when submitting invalid or incomplete details.
